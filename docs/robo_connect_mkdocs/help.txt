# First time setting up MkDocs?

Make sure you have python  installed, and available from your command line/terminal (you may need to add python to your PATH.)
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then install the requirements file in this directory. Modify the path below as required (i.e. where your terminal is)
`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

The mkdocs commands below require your terminal to be in in this directory (i.e. tc-robot/docs/robo_connect_mkdocs).

## Commands
* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
